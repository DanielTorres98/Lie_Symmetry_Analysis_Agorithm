# Lie Symmetry Analysis Agorithm
This repository aims to build an algorithm that is able to find, reduce and solve the determinant equations of an arbitrary system. 

In within the folder Notebooks the file LieSymmetryAnalysis_Test.ipynb contains several example runs for different systems.

The algorithm is able to find the reduced form of the determinant equations. However, it is not able to solve the system yet.

To Run the algorithm the algorithm you first need to install the requirements in a new environment. It can be done by running the followings commands inside the folder ./Lie_Symmetry_Analysis_Algorithm:

## Using conda

conda create -n env_name python=3.9

conda activate env_name

pip install -r requirements.txt
